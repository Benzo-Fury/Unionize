# ðŸ§ª Tests

## âœ… When Should You Write a Test?
Tests ensure critical parts of the bot work correctly across deployments. However, not all code needs testing.

### **Write a test if:**
- The code **depends on external systems** (databases, APIs, environment variables).
- The function **performs complex logic** (data transformations, authentication, security).
- The failure would **cause major issues** in your bot.
- The function **changes often**, increasing the risk of breaking it.

### **You donâ€™t need a test if:**
- The function is **pure and deterministic** (e.g., string formatting, basic math).
- It doesnâ€™t **depend on external dependencies** (e.g., APIs, databases).
- **Failure wouldnâ€™t break core functionality.**

ðŸš€ **Focus on testing what might break on deployment, not simple helper functions!**
