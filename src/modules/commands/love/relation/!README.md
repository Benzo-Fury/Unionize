# Relation Based Commands
Commands in this directory are all related to creating relationships between users. Each command here enables users to form specific relational connections, such as partnerships, adoptions, or parent-child relationships.

Each command uses the Proposal class to streamline the process of creating, sending, and managing relational proposals, ensuring consistency across all relationship-based commands.
